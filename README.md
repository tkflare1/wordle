# Project 1 - _Wordle_

Submitted by: **Tawedzerwa Vhurumuku**

**Wordle** is an app that allow players tp have six tries to guess a hidden five-letter word. After each guess the tiles change colour to show how close the guess was:

- **üü© Green** ‚Äì correct letter in the correct position
- **üü® Gold** ‚Äì correct letter in the wrong position
- **‚¨õÔ∏è Dark** ‚Äì letter not in the word

The game selects a new random target word every time the app launches, so each round is fresh.
